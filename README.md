# ML-ChurnPrediction

ML-ChurnPrediction
Overview:
This project aims to analyze customer churn using exploratory data analysis (EDA) and machine learning models. The goal is to understand the factors influencing churn and build predictive models to identify potential churners.

Key Points:

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Detailed analysis of customer demographics, behavior, and churn patterns.
Utilization of visualizations to understand distributions, correlations, and outliers.
Insights into key features affecting churn rates.

Model Building:

Selection and rationale for machine learning algorithms (e.g., logistic regression, random forest).
Evaluation metrics used for model assessment, including accuracy, precision, and recall.
Techniques employed for handling imbalanced data, such as SMOTE for oversampling or class weights for balancing.

Results:

Summary of model performance metrics.
Comparison between different algorithms based on their performance.
Discussion on actionable insights derived from the analysis.

Next Steps:

Future enhancements or additional features to explore, such as ensemble methods or deep learning approaches.
Opportunities for further research or applications in related domains, including customer retention strategies and personalized marketing.
