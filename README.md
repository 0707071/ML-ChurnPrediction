# ML-ChurnPrediction

Overview:
This project aims to analyze customer churn using exploratory data analysis (EDA) and machine learning models. We explore various factors influencing churn and build predictive models to identify potential churners.

Key Points:
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Detailed analysis of customer demographics, behavior, and churn patterns.
Visualizations to understand distributions, correlations, and outliers.
Insights into key features affecting churn rates.
Model Building:

Selection of appropriate machine learning algorithms (e.g., logistic regression, random forest).
Evaluation metrics (accuracy, precision, recall) for model assessment.
Techniques used for handling imbalanced data (e.g., SMOTE, class weights).
Results:

Summary of model performance and comparison between different algorithms.
Discussion on actionable insights derived from the analysis.

Next Steps
Future enhancements or additional features to be explored (e.g., ensemble methods, deep learning approaches).
Opportunities for further research or applications in related domains (e.g., customer retention strategies, personalized marketing).
